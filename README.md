# Auto Turn In
*Auto Turn In* is inspired another Auto Questing addon called [Get to the Point](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/get-to-the-point).  
GTTP suited about 95% of my needs and I suggest you check it out if you want a little more control over which quests you are automatically accepting/completing.  
The main difference is that this doesn't require you to do any manual configuration to set a quest as auto accept/complete.  

If you've completed the quest once, it will try to automatically accept it and complete it in the future, across characters.
You can tell it to not automatically accept or complete quests: hold down **SHIFT** while interacting the the quest NPC to ignore specific quests.  
To *un*-ignore a quest, hold down **CTRL** while interacting with the quest NPC.  

*Auto Turn In* can also automatically choosed dialog options.  
However, this **does** require manual configuration.  
To automatically select dialog options, hold down **CTRL** while selecting the option.  
To stop automatically selecting dialog options, hold down **SHIFT** while selecting the option.
