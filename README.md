# Auto Turn In
*Auto Turn In* is inspired another Auto Questing addon called [Get to the Point](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/get-to-the-point).  
GTTP suited about 95% of my needs and I suggest you check it out if you want a little more control over which quests you are automatically accepting/completing.  
The main difference is that this doesn't require you to do any manual configuration to set a quest as auto accept/complete.  
If you've completed the quest once, it will try to automatically accept it and complete it in the future, across characters.
You can tell it to not automatically accept or complete quests by holding down **SHIFT** while interacting the the quest NPC.  
To *un*-ignore a quest, hold down **CTRL** while interacting with the quest NPC.
